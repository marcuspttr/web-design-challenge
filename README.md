# web-design-challenge
Creating pages to show off visualizations and analysis.

## Some thoughts:
This was an adaptation of an activity we did in class so I used a lot of the same structure.
Adding the dynamic circle sizes and coloration made the graph really come together.
However I did struggle getting the colors to show up on my legend.

## Here is a sample picture showing what the site looks like after selecting a new subject:

## Final thoughts:
I'm very happy with the map's final appearance. Ran out of time to attempt the bonus, but I liked how it came out.
