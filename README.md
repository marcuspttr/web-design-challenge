Creating pages to show off visualizations and analysis.

## Some thoughts:
This was an interesting assignment.  We had previously done the calculations, so it was nice to call this work back and create both interesting visualizations but also a space to view them.

## Here is a sample picture showing what the site looks like after selecting a new subject:

## Final thoughts:
I'm very happy with the map's final appearance. Ran out of time to attempt the bonus, but I liked how it came out.
